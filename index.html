<p> This is a picture, taken by my radio-controlled airplane. It is actually
cropped because the original was over half sky and trees.</p>
<p>You may click on this picture to see the original.</p>
<img src="campus3.jpg">
<p> This is a copy of that picture, saved as a .jpg with a quality of 10.
The trees have become smudges, and many details are now fuzzy.
</p>
<p><img src="campus4.jpg" width="120">This is a better version of the picture, only we have distorted it by 
making it appear as 120x120.</p>
